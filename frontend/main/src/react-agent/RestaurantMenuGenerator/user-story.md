Title: PDF Menu Generator for Restaurants

User Story:
As a restaurant owner, I want to create a user-friendly web platform to generate customized PDF menus for my restaurant, so that I can easily and quickly design attractive menus without needing design expertise.

Description:
The PDF Menu Generator will allow users to input their restaurant's dishes and descriptions through a dynamic questionnaire. The platform will offer predefined design templates but will adapt based on the content provided by the user. It will consist of three main sections: Header, MenuContent, and Sections, each aimed to simplify and expedite the menu creation process.

Acceptance Criteria:

1. Header:
   a. RestaurantSwitcher: Allows users to switch between different restaurant profiles.
   b. MenuNav: Provides easy navigation to different stages of the menu creation process.
   c. HeaderActions: Incorporates a save function to store the current progress and a navigation menu for accessing account details.

2. MenuContent:
   a. MenuHeader: Enables users to input their restaurant name, logo, and other relevant details.

   b. Sections: Allows users to categorize menu items:
   i. DishCardsContainer: Users can add, edit, or delete dishes, along with their descriptions and prices.

   ii. DesignPreview: Displays a real-time preview of the menu as the user adds or adjusts content, offering a glimpse of the final product.

3. Export Functionality: Users should be able to generate and download the finished menu in a PDF format with one click.

Out of Scope:

1. Integration with food delivery platforms or third-party payment gateways.
2. Real-time updates to already printed menus; users will need to reprint for changes.

Dependencies:

1. Backend API to store user data and generate PDFs.
2. Design team to provide a variety of aesthetically pleasing menu templates.

Milestones:

1. Finalize the menu generator requirements and acceptance criteria.
2. Design team to create diverse menu templates.
3. Development team to construct the frontend interface and backend functionalities.
4. QA team to validate platform stability, usability, and PDF generation quality.
5. Launch of the PDF Menu Generator to the public platform.
