Title: Intuitive PDF Menu Generator for Restaurants

User Story:
As a restaurant owner, I need a straightforward web platform to produce customizable PDF menus, ensuring quick creation without design expertise.

Description:
The PDF Menu Generator will allow users to input dishes and descriptions through a dynamic questionnaire, leveraging adaptive predefined design templates. It comprises three core sections: Header, MenuContent, and Sections, designed for ease and efficiency.

Acceptance Criteria:

1. Header:
   a. RestaurantSwitcher: Toggle between different restaurant profiles.
   b. MenuNav: Navigate through the creation stages.
   c. HeaderActions: Save current progress and access account details.

2. MenuContent:
   a. MenuHeader: Input restaurant details including name and logo.

   b. Sections: Categorize menu items:
   i. DishCardsContainer: Add, edit, or delete dishes, descriptions, and prices.

   ii. DesignPreview: Real-time menu preview as content is adjusted.

3. Export Feature: One-click generation and download of the final menu in PDF.

Out of Scope:

1. Integrations with food delivery platforms or payment gateways.
2. Real-time updates to already printed menus; reprinting required for changes.

Dependencies:

1. Backend API for user data storage and PDF generation.
2. Design team for menu template creation.

Milestones:

1. Define menu generator requirements and acceptance criteria.
2. Design team crafts menu templates.
3. Dev team builds frontend UI and backend functionalities.
4. QA tests platform stability, usability, and PDF output.
